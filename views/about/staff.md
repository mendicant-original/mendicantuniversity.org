### Our Staff

Mendicant University was founded by Gregory Brown ([@seacreature](http://twitter.com/seacreature)), author of the book [Ruby Best Practices](http://rubybestpractices.com) and original author of the popular PDF generation library [Prawn](http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com).  Gregory hopes that Mendicant University will serve as a good example of what can happen when the ideas behind the Free Software Movement are applied to education.

Jordan Byron ([@Jordan_Byron](http://twitter.com/jordan_byron)) serves as our technical coordinator, and is the maintainer of Mendicant University's classroom administration software, [university-web](https://github.com/mendicant-university/university-web). In addition to doing commercial work through [Madriska](http://madriska.com), Jordan volunteers his time working on CT Mission of Mercy's [clinic management system](https://github.com/jordanbyron/mission_of_mercy).

Jia Wu is Mendicant University's administrative coordinator, and assists with various miscellaneous tasks that would otherwise be neglected by Jordan and Gregory.  Jia is a post-doctoral psychology researcher at the Yale Child Study Center, where she works on developing software for experiments as well as statistical programming for brain wave analysis.  Jia is also Gregory's wife, and is responsible for tearing him away from the computer every once in a while.

Shane Emmons ([@semmons99](http://twitter.com/semmons99)) joined our staff in June 2011, and is the first teacher at Mendicant University who is also an alumnus. Shane is active in the open source community as a maintainer of the RubyMoney projects (<https://github.com/RubyMoney>) and the author of cashrb (<https://github.com/semmons99/cashrb>).

Eric Gjertsen ([ericgj](https://github.com/ericgj) on github) is the
newest alumni member of our staff, joining in September 2011. Before
joining staff, Eric worked closely with us for many months to expand our one-on-one mentoring program. He is now officially responsible for
running that project as well as helping us develop Mendicant University's broader social mission. Eric is a community activist who has been hacking with ruby since 2005, and looks forward to finding new ways to make software useful to the world.

Andrea Singh ([@madebydna](http://twitter.com/madebydna)) was invited to join
the MU staff in November 2011. Since becoming an alumna in September 2010, she
has been actively involved in many diverse MU activities, ranging from
mentoring, being an assistant teacher in the core course to helping to create
puzzles for the MU entrance exams. Andrea started out with front-end web
development and began programming in earnest after discovering Rails several
years ago. She grew up in Germany, lived for eight years in Hawaii and recently
moved to New Haven, CT, where she now works as a freelance Ruby developer.
