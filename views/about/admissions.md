### Getting Involved With Mendicant University

We are not currently accepting new students, but stay tuned for announcements of new entrance exams and other public events on our [news page](/changelog.html).  While you're waiting, you can meet with current Mendicant participants and discuss the program in the #mendicant IRC channel on Freenode.

We occasionally hold events that are open to the public, such as meetings with guest speakers or study sessions hosted by our staff and alumni. These events will also be announced on our [news page](/changelog.html), so be sure to keep an eye on it if you'd like to get involved.

Feel free to [contact us](/about/contact.html) if you have any questions
