We are committed to producing free and open source software.  Here you'll find the tooling we've built to run Mendicant University.

### Core Projects

Much of our current work is Mendicant-specific, but may still be of interest to folks running online courses.  Active projects include:

  * [university-web](https://github.com/mendicant-university/university-web): Course administration and student management web app
  * [mendibot](https://github.com/mendicant-university/mendibot): IRC bot which among other things posts chat transcripts to university-web
  * [scheduler](https://github.com/mendicant-university/scheduler): Utility for scheduling meetings (MIT License)
  * [puzzlenode](https://github.com/mendicant-university/puzzlenode): Quiz application inspired by [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) and the [Internet Problem
  Solving Contest](http://ipsc.ksp.sk/) (IPSC)
